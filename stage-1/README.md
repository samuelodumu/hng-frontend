# hng-frontend Stage 1

A color guessing game built with HTML CSS and JavaScript.

### Improvements I can make

1. Adding a high score feature and celebration effect (I'm thinking sound and confetti) when the score is passed
2. Adding a dark mode feature
3. Implementing localStorage to store user preferences
