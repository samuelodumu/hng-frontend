### Improvements I can make

1. Adding a high score feature and celebration effect (I'm thinking sound and confetti) when the score is passed
2. Adding a dark mode feature
3. Implementing localStorage to store user preferences
4. Display encouraging messages on each correct guess and slightly discouraging messages on each failed guess
5. Make different levels of strictness, e.g.
- **Easy** - when you guess wrong in this level, your score remains the same, you just get a 'try again message' or something like that
- **Medium** - here, when  you guess wrong your score reduces by the same score it increases along with the message.
- **Hard** - the current (and only) mode right now, where your score goes back to zero on every wrong guess. Still have to add the 'sad' message to go with it.
